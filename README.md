# fundeps

An experimental CLI tool for visualization of elm declaration dependencies.
This tool depends on [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) being installed on your system.

# TODOs
* Make the autocompletion work for queries of the form `Module:function` even for modules from external packages
* Ask for confirmation when displaying too large graphs
* Find better way how to integrate hacked elm compiler into the tool
