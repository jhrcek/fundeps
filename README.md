# fundeps

An experimental CLI tool for visualization of elm declaration dependencies.

# TODOs
* Deal with cases when \*.usages files are not found
* Make the autocompletion work for queries of the form `Module:function` even for modules from external packages
* Ask for confirmation when displaying too large graphs
* Add `:export svg|png|dot \<query\>` command
